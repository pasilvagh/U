19|1||Key Recovery Alliance (KRA) Technology Papers, Special Issue â Introduction|
19|1||Cryptographic Information Recovery Using Key Recovery|AbstractA note to readers: the authors consider that all techniques for key recovery may be viewed as having a position on a broad continuum. The only way to avoid misunderstanding is to identify particular techniques by listing their specific characteristics, rather than using multiply-defined terms. Different characteristics have advantages in different environments, so there is no ‘best’ key recovery technique. The paper notes some typical advantages and disadvantages of several techniques but should not be construed as an endorsement of any particular technique relative to another. Similarly, the authors recognize that terminology may vary from country to country.Cryptographic information recovery techniques provide for the recovery of plaintext from encrypted data. This (exceptional) need arises when the cryptographic keys involved are not available. For example, data files may have been encrypted using a key derived from a now forgotten or misplaced password. Overlapping and confusing terminology has been applied to the techniques of information recovery, including key escrow, key backup, key recovery, and trusted third party (ttp), all of which refer to methods for retrieving, recovering, or re-constructing keys. Even the underlying concept of ‘trust’ has broad meaning. Instead of attempting to ‘define’ these terms precisely, a continuum of functionality is defined. Several generic technologies, together with desirable characteristics of cryptographic information/key recovery techniques, are described. 
19|1||Features, Attributes, Characteristics, and Traits (FACTs) of Key Recovery Schemes/Products|
19|1||Key Recovery Functional Model|AbstractThis document describes a model for key recovery. The means by which plaintext may be recovered or reconstructed from recovered key(s) is not addressed in the key recovery model. The key recovery model is a generalized model that encompasses a wide variety of key recovery systems, including both key backup and encapsulated key recovery information techniques. The key recovery model is a functional model. That is, the components of the model are functional components not system components. 
19|1||Additional Key Recovery Functions|AbstractThis document describes additional functions that may be required by specific implementations of the key recovery model. This document should not be read in isolation, but must be read in conjunction with the Key Recovery Functional Model document. 
19|1||A Common Key Recovery Block Format: Promoting Interoperability Between Dissimilar Key Recovery Mechanisms|AbstractWhen cryptographic products that employ different key recovery mechanisms need to interoperate with one another, one of the major obstacles is the inability of the decryptor product to recognize, and optionally validate, the key recovery information generated by the encryptor product. In this paper, a common Key Recovery Block (KRB) format is being proposed to facilitate interoperability between heterogeneous key recovery systems. The KRB serves as a container for mechanism-specific key recovery information, and supports techniques to identify and optionally validate the contained key recovery information. This specification provides an extensible set of KRB validation techniques - however, it makes no attempt to set a preference for one technique over the others. The choice of validation technique(s) used is determined by the policies (with respect to the use of cryptography and key recovery) that apply to the encryptor and decryptor products. It may be noted that the KRB format specification is independent of the encryption algorithm used to protect the confidentiality of the data, and independent of the communication or storage protocol used to carry the encrypted data.It should also be recognized that the KRB format proposed in this paper is of limited scope. It assumes that the key recovery information can be made available to interested parties along with the encrypted data. There are a number of open issues regarding the techniques that allow key recovery information to be associated with encrypted data (whether the key recovery information and the encrypted data are transmitted over the same channel or separate channels) — these issues are beyond the scope of this proposal. 
19|1||Global Interoperability for Key Recovery|AbstractThis document describes techniques for implementing key recovery. The document then addresses interoperability between encryptors and decryptors using the key encapsulation method of key recovery. The Common Key Recovery Block is presented as a cornerstone for interoperability. The interoperability is summarized in an interoperability matrix for key recovery systems. 
19|1||Public Key Infrastructure: Analysis of Existing and Needed Protocols and Object Formats for Key Recovery|AbstractThis document identifies the impacts to a public key infrastructure (PKI) created by the presence of key recovery, as well as elements in the public key infrastructure needed to support or accommodate key recovery. The key recovery infrastructure includes key recovery techniques based both on (1) encapsulation of key recovery information and (2) key backup. The data applications covered by the study include interactive communication sessions, store-and-forward communications, and data storage. The document identifies and lists elements of existing PKI that support or accommodate key recovery, and it identifies and lists needed changes to PKI to support or accommodate key recovery. 
19|1||Organization Implementation Guidelines for Recovery of Encrypted Information|
19|1||Organization Considerations for Retrieval of Stored Data via Key Recovery Methods|AbstractThe purpose of this document is to identify technical and procedural issues that need to be considered when selecting and deploying key recovery systems to enable emergency recovery of data that is stored or archived in encrypted form. Emergency recovery of encrypted data is necessary in the event that the decryption keys are unavailable through normal key management mechanisms. In many cases, the need to support emergency recovery of encrypted data is vital to ongoing operations and jurisdictional policy compliance. A disaster recovery plan may also give consideration to an ability to recover many data keys by using a single key recovery request. 
19|1||Key Recovery Header for IPSEC|AbstractThis document describes a mechanism for transmitting a key recovery header (KRH) within an IPSEC datagram. The KRH is normally inserted following the AH header and before the ESP header. The Key Recovery Header was designed to be compatible with IETF’s IPSEC Architecture. 
19|1||ISAKMP Key Recovery Extensions|AbstractThis document describes the proposed approach for negotiating and exchanging key recovery information within the Internet Security Association Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP). 
19|1||SSL/TLS Protocol Enablement for Key Recovery|AbstractThis document describes an approach for modifying the SSL/TLS (TLS) protocol to allow transmission of Key Recovery Block (KRBs) before communication takes place between clients and servers using strong encryption techniques. From a TLS perspective “strong encryption” implies use of a session key with the secret portion being larger than 40 bits.

19|2||A Formalized Approach to the Effective Selection and Evaluation of Information Security Controls|AbstractElectronic commerce holds many advantages for the commercial world, but before it can really take off, the associated information security problems need to be addressed satisfactorily. The identification, implementation and management of the most effective set of controls to provide an adequate level of security is the first step towards this goal. The second step is the possible evaluation and certification of the installed controls in an IT-environment.The selection of the security controls should be driven by the business needs and the associated security requirement. This security requirement should be clearly defined in the information security policy and the security policy should dictate the set of controls that will provide the required protection. If this set of controls can be evaluated and certified as meeting the business needs of the organization, the trust that is required for electronic commerce can be provided. This paper will provide a formalized approach towards identifying a set of controls meeting the business needs and also suggest a model whereby this can be evaluated and certified.

19|3||Information Systems Risk Management: Key Concepts and Business Processes|AbstractInformation systems risk management is as a problem area extremely wide, complex and of an interdisciplinary nature, which highlights the importance of having an adequate understanding of the many concepts that are included in the area. Dealing with definitions of those concepts is a somewhat ‘boring’ task, however probably it can be considered to be an important one. In the second part of this article my attempt is to move to perhaps more ‘exciting’ things, namely to highlight the significant importance that business processes and internal controls have in IS risk management. 
19|3||Information Security Management: A Hierarchical Framework for Various Approaches|AbstractThe present article is aimed at clarifying the oft-times confusing terminology and at elucidating the various approaches obtaining to the realm of Information Security (IS) management. The IS management approaches selected for discussion in this article will specifically address those rudiments and concepts that play a key role in the assessment of the IS status of an organization. Following, a hierarchical framework will be developed in terms of which to elucidate ill-defined terms and concepts. By so doing, issues such as certification, benchmarking, guidelines and codes of practice will come under consideration. IS management approaches widely accepted in the international arena will also be mapped onto the said hierarchical framework.

19|3||Achieving Interoperability in a Multiple-Security- Policies Environment|AbstractThe interoperability problems that emerge when information systems cooperate, are often attributed to incompatible security policies. In this paper, we introduce a systemic framework for achieving interoperability when multiple security policies are employed. First, we present a Metapolicy Development System (MDS) for the resolution of interoperability problems caused by incompatible security policies. Then we provide a policy framework and a metapolicy framework to serve as conceptual devices in the application of the MDS. Finally, we examine the possibility of developing software tools to support the MDS. We argue that a policy repository may serve as the basic component of a software tool for the management of multiple security policies and the application of the MDS. The policy repository is implemented in Telos, an object-oriented knowledge representation language. 
19|3||Generation of RSA Keys That Are Guaranteed to be Unique for Each User|AbstractThis paper describes a method for assuring that the RSA primes generated by two different parties will always be different. While this condition is not required for the RSA signatures and encryption, this user-dependence of RSA primes is highly desirable in view of possible disputes around the authenticity of a digital signature. A cheating party may claim that a pair of prime numbers was generated by someone else. Our method will eliminate such possibility and will make the entire class of attacks obsolete. In addition to being different when different users derive them, the RSA primes generated according to the algorithm described in this paper will satisfy all of the requirements imposed by the national and international standards.

That is, a group of individuals might have to present valid readings of biometrics parameters in order to gain access to a system or application in order to receive authorization to use a particular resource. Such multiparty schemes can often provide greater protection. This paper presents several techniques for multiparty biometric-based authentication. It also shows a technique for biometric substitution which allows different biometrics to be used concurrently or substituted over time.

19|5||A Biometric Standard for Information Management and Security|AbstractToday, biometric systems are being widely developed and deployed to provide greater security to users and there is an increased awareness of the value of biometric systems. Biometric systems are being developed and deployed, users are gaining experience and confidence in biometric systems and are beginning to reap the benefits of this technology. Users and developers of this technology have also recognized the need for a biometric standard and work on a defining standard is currently underway. The standard establishes an appropriate biometric model and the associated security requirements that will allow different biometric solutions to co-exist in the marketplace. The standard views biometric systems within a global user community and it assures that the security of any one biometric system will be unaffected by the security of any other biometric system. This paper argues that integrity of authentication data is the primary security requirement and that confidentiality is secondary, even though the majority of authentication schemes today encrypt PINs and passwords.

19|5||A Generic Electronic Payment Model Supporting Multiple Merchant Transactions|AbstractThis paper presents a generic electronic payment model which is intended for a multi-merchant transaction, in which more than one merchant (the retailer, multiple resellers and content providers) are involved in the distribution of electronic contents. With our payment model, every involved merchant will be notified to verify the license information of a content on the settlement day before the customer actually pays for his purchase. Thus, piracy can be discouraged, intellectual property rights of electronic contents can be protected. Each of the involved merchants can obtain his own deserved share of the customer’s payment in accordance with their union agreement on this content. As examples to demonstrate the applications of our generic payment model, two well-known payment systems are enhanced herein, based on our payment model. 
19|5||Methods for Protecting Password Transmission|AbstractIn this paper, we present a secure method for protecting passwords while being transmitted over untrusted networks. We also present a secure method for changing an old password to a new password. The proposed solutions do not require the use of any additional keys (such as symmetric keys or public/private keys) to protect password exchanges. Unlike existing solutions, the proposed schemes do not use any symmetric-key or public-key cryptosystems (such as DES, RC5, RSA, etc.). Our schemes only employ a collision-resistant hash function such as SHA-1.

19|6||Authentication and Supervision: A Survey of User Attitudes|AbstractUser authentication is a vital element in ensuring the secure operation of IT systems. In the vast majority of cases, this role is fulfilled by the password, but evidence suggests that this approach is easily compromised. Whilst many alternatives exist, particularly in the form of biometric methods, questions remain over the likely user acceptance. This paper presents the results of a survey that examines user attitudes towards a range of authentication and supervision techniques. It is concluded that whilst there is still an element of reluctance amongst users to depart from the familiar password based mechanisms, many are convinced of the need for improved authentication controls. The acceptability to users of various new techniques is variable, but many seem willing to consider a range of alternative methods.

While some of the algorithms that served this purpose already existed in the literature, our methodology has significant practical advantages. The two methods we show are more straightforward, by giving a user a chance, in some cases, to operate on one value rather than two. They give the user the flexibility to select the most appropriate algorithm. They provide for a reasonable sharing of the workload between the user and the timestamping authority.

The present research investigated the effect of three different word association formulation techniques on recall rates when participants were presented with their original cue words after a 2 week retention interval. Differences in the susceptibility of word associations to being guessed by someone the participant knew well were also examined. In the ‘response only’ group (n = 24), respondents were provided with a list of 20 cue words and were required to generate an associated response for each cue. In the ‘cues and responses’ group (n = 25), respondents generated both cues and associated responses, while in the ‘theme’ group (n = 24), respondents generated both cue and response words having first decided upon a theme for their word associations. The average recall and guessing rates were 66% and 8%, respectively. No statistically significant differences in recall or guessing rates were found between the three groups. The effect sizes obtained strongly suggest that insufficient statistical power was available to produce significant effects. Nevertheless, it is tentatively concluded that the formulation techniques employed have only a small effect on ease of recall. Future research on the utility of word associations as computer passwords needs to be based in a real computer security setting.

19|8||Information Security Management: An Approach to Combine Process Certification And Product Evaluation|AbstractInformation Security (IS) is the key to the effective management of any organisation in today’s commercial and industrial sectors. Line managers’ performance, for instance, is rated according to the extent to which their operations conform to the IS policies of their respective organizations. In the same way, senior management’s performance is judged by how well the organization performs in terms of internationally accepted codes of IS practice. IS management, however, is not always a quantifiable entity and its evaluation is complicated by the fact that it can be viewed either from an electronic perspective, in which case the focus will fall solely on product and/or systems evaluation, or from a procedural and management perspective, in which case the focus will, instead, fall on the certification of the IS management process. This article will, therefore, be devoted to providing a consolidated approach to the evaluation of IS management, in terms of which full cognisance will be taken of both these perspectives.

This architecture consists of a reference model, a functional architecture specification, and a set of technologies that can be used for implementing the functional units, along with all relevant standards. It was derived within the course of the KEYSTONE project, which was funded by the European Commission under the Electronic Trust Services II Programme. The proposed PKI architecture guarantees openness, scalability, flexibility, extensibility, integration with existing TTP and information infrastructure, transparency and, above all, security. Thus, it enjoys all the desirable characteristics and fulfils all those criteria that are essential for a PKI to constitute a successful framework for the development of inter-domain and international Trusted Services.

20|1||Abstracts of Recent Articles and Literature|AbstractLaw on cracking security codes toughened,Amy Harmon. The US copyright office has passed a new law making it illegal to break the security methods in place to prevent the copying of digital music, books and movies. The law will update the existing 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act and will come into effect immediately. The decision was opposed by groups such as Universities, programmers and libraries who argue that copyrighted work should be archived and leant out. Programmers also claimed that reverse-engineering was a valid technique in the cause of learning how technology works. The Association of American Universities has stated that in order to maintain civil liberties, there must be broad exemptions to allow for “fair use” of purchased copyrighted digital goods. The Toronto Star, 30 October, E3.Game could hold key to Net security,Gareth Cook. According to top mathematicians, the key to cracking encryption algorithms could be linked to the popular Minesweeper game which comes free with the Windows operating system. The problem, the ‘P versus NP conjecture’, asks why some problems are so difficult to solve using a computer, while others can be solved very quickly. Problems like putting a list into alphabetical order, which are easily solved by a computer are classified as P problems, and those which cannot are classed as NP. A prominent specialist challenged the conjecture in the spring edition of the Mathematical Intelligencer journal, saying that the conjecture would be proved false if the Minesweeper logic game could be cracked, for any sized board, using a computer program. If the conjecture is true, then certain types of problem will always remain insoluble by computers and the current system of encryption algorithms will continue to be considered to be safe. The Clay Mathematical Institute considers the matter to be so important that they have offered a US $1 million prize for a solution. The impact of such a discovery would be to mathematically map the boundary beyond which computers, no matter how powerful, cannot succeed. The Boston Globe, 1 November, B1, B4.MOJ proposes new laws to crack down on hackers. The Japanese Ministry of Justice has announced that it intends to toughen up Taiwan’s Criminal Code as it relates to hackers. Those who break into government, military or financial institutions would face up to 15 year jail sentences. Officials also say that any form of hacking over the Internet should be made illegal. The code will address holes in legislation relating to computer crimes and will also criminalize the distribution of pornography and selling of prohibited substances while regulating the responsibilities of ISPs, pornographic websites and those which facilitate gambling. The China Post, 23 October.Canada’s computer security loopholes called threat to US.David Akin. James Adams, senior security advisor to the US, told the PopTech2000 conference that Canada is incapable of defending itself against attacks against its telecommunications and computer networks. This endangers the US because “Canada is essentially the back door into America”, due to the amount of major US corporations which have Canadian offices. The private sector in the US and Canada do not have the right to share information gleaned by the security agencies, which leaves it more vulnerable that those from countries like France, Israel, China, Russia and India. The criticism comes as 30 countries including the US, but not Canada, are gearing up to simulate information warfare attacks. Adams also warned against purchasing hardware and software from France, China, India or Russia, “We know without any question whatsoever that a lot of things that are sold in the United States, be it a firewall or some software, are infected with implants from these countries so that anything that goes across their networks, or is stored in their programs is sent back to the country of manufacture.” Canadian National Post, 30 October.Viruses the next generation, Kim Zetter. Viruses are getting faster and more prolific. They have been around since the early 60s when they infected through floppy disks, the ‘sneaker net’. They can go around the world in minutes, sent by E-mail. With the trend within industry to use the same off the shelf products — Windows, Word, Outlook — viruses can hit millions of machines in one fell swoop. Ron Moritz at Symantec, an anti-virus company, said, “If the virus writers ever thought through their programs, we would see much more virulent viruses that would really do damage.” The threat is growing worse, and although anti-virus software is important, it can only target a virus once it has hit a few computers. In the future, viruses are likely to spread without you having to open an E-mail — a stage beyond Bubbleboy and Kak. Fred Cohen, who coined the phrase ‘computer virus’, describes mini-viruses which will dodge detection and spawn sub-variants which will cluster and attack various parts of your computer. They have already hit PDAs and mobile phones and Linux will be the next victims. The automation of inoculation has been considered as a possible protection, however it is feared that this would pass too much control onto the software suppliers — and the consequences of a hacker intercepting such a transfer would be disastrous. Others want to ban the writing of malicious code, but this is deemed to be against the principals of freedom of speech. Moritz predicts that the next generation of viruses will combine swift propagation like the Melissa and LoveLetter viruses with a destructive payload — something that neither of these two debilitating viruses actually had. NewLove followed on from LoveLetter the next month, June 1999, and closely resembles a super-virus. It had a damaging payload, overwriting system files and making computers inoperable, and could spread quickly. However, fortunately, it failed because it was so acerbic that it destroyed Outlook before it could be mailed on, and so failed to multiply. But the greatest fear is that the technology will be used for cyber-warfare. Protection in the form of anti-virus software affords some comfort, but the users must also learn caution when on the Internet or using E-mail. PC World, December, p.p. 191–203.IPSec VPNs: they’re not all virtually the same,Isaac Hillson. What you need from a VPN is speed of throughput, simple management and security that you can trust. All of the products out there have been assembled to the same IPSec standards, however there are massive differences in functionality. An independent test of 12 systems was commissioned from Network Test (www.networktest.com). The results were worrying, as some were “alarmingly vulnerable to attack”. Some of the products were 10 times faster than others, there was varying interoperability with Certificate Authorities and PKI standards were a bit of a let down. However, the best systems are definitely worth a look. The top three were Intel’s Netstructure 3130, Lucent’s VPN firewall and Alcatel’s Secure VPN Solution. The systems tested ranged from $2000 to $21â000 and full results can be found at www.commweb.com. Computer Telephony, November, p. 138.Shockwave virus creates little damage,Jaikumar Vijayan. The virus Shockwave, first reported at the end of November appears to be spreading more slowly than was expected thanks, at least in part, to an increased awareness of the spread of E-mail viruses. The virus disguises itself as an attachment to an E-mail called creative.exe and appears to come from a familiar E-mail address. If a recipient double clicks on this attachment the virus replicates onto the victim’s system and sends new copies of itself via E-mail to all the addresses in the E-mail address book. It doesn’t destroy any files, but it does rename some graphics and .zip files. Computerworld, 11 December 2000, p. 24.Is Carnivore dangerous? Controversy continues,Michael Meehan. Researchers studying the FBI’s Carnivore E-mail surveillance system have “serious concerns” about the controversial technology, despite a generally favourable draft report. The five researchers said that the review carried out by the IIT Research Institute “appears to represent a good-faith effort at [an] independent review” of the surveillance system. But, they added, “the limited nature of the analysis described in the draft report simply cannot support a conclusion that Carnivore is correct, safe or always consistent with legal limitations”. Carnivore can be legally deployed only to monitor alleged criminal activity under a court order, but privacy advocates have said that they are worried that the software could lead to widespread and random surveillance of E-mail messages. The researchers took particular issue with what they said are vague and alterable audit trails within Carnivore. Without a definitive audit trail it would be impossible to determine who had monitored what. One of the researchers said that Carnivore could be misconfigured to monitor almost anything. Computerworld, 11 December 2000, p. 24.Virus vigilance,Deborah Radcliff. In the year since ‘I LoveYou’ struck variants of this self-replicating virus are still reaching the mailbox. It seems as though a new variant strikes every day. In a two-week period a plethora of new viruses were reported, including variants of Romeo & Juliet, Navidad, Afeto and Shockwave. Like Melissa and I LoveYou they all take advantage of mail programs to spread. The problem with today’s viruses is two-fold: not only can they be easily altered to change their signatures, but they also have tempting attachment types to persuade users to open them. No matter how often you tell users not to open executables some will succumb to temptation and training is not enough. It is necessary to set up filters to block executable attachments before they enter the desktop. Blocking file types known to carry viruses and Trojan horses sounds extreme, but if these attachments aren’t used for business purposes the decision is easier. Microsoft Outlook 2000 E-mail security patch was designed to filter a number of executable file types. In addition, a number of vendors offer filtering products that can block custom-specified file types and even subject lines. So keep your anti-virus software up to date, educate your users and block unnecessary executables at the gate. Computerworld, 11 December 2000, p. 68.Bush eyes overhaul of E-security,Dan Verton. In the United States, national security experts are preparing for what could be a major change in the way the Government and the private sector prevent cyberattacks. President Elect Bush plans to appoint an IT ‘czar’ to better manage the Government’s IT investments. That move is likely to involve reorganizing the federal critical infrastructure protection effort and possibly changing the role of the FBI’s National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC). Changes to NIPC could involve asking Congress for new legislation to make it easier for the national security community to get access to investigative information, making NIPC subordinate to a federal IT czar or security officer, or starting from scratch with a different type of organization. Computerworld, 18 December 2000, p. 1, 85.Hospital confirms hacker stole 5000 patient files,Marc Songini. A major hospital in Seattle, Washington, USA confirmed that during last summer a hacker penetrated its computer network and stole files containing information on 5000 patients. Officials at the University of Washington Medical Center said that the hacker, calling himself ‘Kane’, stole users’ passwords and copied thousands of files. The hacker gained access to the hospital’s network through an exposed Linux server in the hospital’s pathology department. The medical centre suspected a breach but was unaware that the files had been stolen until Kane provided information about the intrusion to SecurityFocus.com, a website that focuses on security issues. Kane, who is believed to live in the Netherlands, sent the files to the website to verify that he had accessed sensitive data. Kane it is believed, views himself as an ethical hacker. He used sniffer software to steal the electronic identifications of a number of hospital employees from the exposed server and then used the credentials to access files related to patients in the medical centre’s cardiology and rehabilitation departments. Computerworld, 18 December 2000, p. 7.Hacker cracks Egghead’s security. Online technology retailer Egghead.com had revealed that a hacker penetrated its computer systems, possibly including the customer databases where the company stores credit-card numbers and other personal information about the users of its website. Egghead reported the hacking incident to credit-card companies “as a precautionary measure”, in case card numbers had been stolen by the intruder. Computerworld, 1 January 2001, p. 6.Big brother plan slammed,Steve Ranger. A proposal by the security services in the UK to collect and keep records on phone and Web usage for seven years by everyone in the country has been attacked by MPs and industry experts. The document, written by the deputy director general of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, said that telephone operators and Internet service providers should hold onto phone records, mobile phone location data, E-mail and Web usage information for a year. The data would then by moved to a government data warehouse for another six years. A budget of £3 million has been proposed to set up the warehouse, which would be combined with the project to develop the controversial ‘black boxes’ which ISPs would plug into systems to snoop on E-mail and Web activity. The communications industry is concerned that it may by caught between demands from law enforcement to retain information and the Data Protection Act, under which it must delete information as soon as it can. Computing, 7 December 2000, p. 3.Network Associates says code is safe,Ian Lynch. The anti-virus company, Network Associates, denies that its anti-virus source code was compromised by hackers following a breach of security at two of the company’s Brazilian sites. “No files or data were compromised by the hack”, said Jack Clark. The company claims that the hackers only accessed sites hosted by a local contractor, Brazilian Internet service provider Matrix. Clark admitted that the company was embarrassed by the incident. “It’s embarrassing. Using a local ISP was deemed to be a better solution at the time, as it was thought to give our Brazilian customers better performance. It appears that Matrix was slower responding to a published security vulnerability than we’d have liked it to have been.” Computing, 7 December 2000, p. 8.IBM provides key to faster secure communications,John Geralds. IBM has developed a way of simultaneously performing software encryption and authentication that it claims is twice as fast as other methods. The security algorithm, which has yet to be given a name, uses the same secret key to encrypt and decrypt a message. Existing approaches require encryption and authentication to be performed separately to ensure secure communications. Using parallel processors gives even faster performance as the encryption is spread over multiple processors. IBM also expects the algorithm to be used in fibre optic networks and several E-business applications. The company has submitted the algorithm to the National Institute of Standards as a standard for securing communications. Computing, 7 December 2000, p. 10.National security threatened by Internet, studies say,Dan Verton. During the next 15 years, the US will face a new breed of Internet-enabled terrorists, criminals and national adversaries that could launch attacks with computer viruses and logic bombs. A report by the CIA’s National Intelligence Council (NIC) mentioned critical electronic infrastructure protection and information warfare only briefly, it warned Americans that adversaries worldwide are hard at work developing tools to bring down the USA’s private sector infrastructure. Another report, by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, went even further, warning of a future cyber arms race and the rise of terrorist groups supported by “computer-literate youngsters” bent on disrupting the Internet. China is of particular concern because it’s devising strategies for unrestricted electronic warfare. Online extortion and falsification of shipping manifests by criminals, and attempts by countries to use hacking techniques to evade trade sanctions are a growing concern. Officials are also becoming increasingly concerned with the proliferation of ‘always on’ Internet applications, such as modems and network printers. Hackers are finding ways to penetrate these devices and possibly use them as launching pads for more devastating distributed denial-of-service attacks. Computerworld, 1 January 2001, p. 7.CSSA targets security issues for E-commerce,Andy McCue. E-commerce companies will be told by their trade associations to take a more targeted approach to security. The Computing Services and Software Association (CSSA) is working with the Alliance for Electronic Business in the UK to spearhead a programme that will allow companies to report security incidents anonymously for analysis by security experts. Users will have access to tailored guidelines for their industry sector based on the principles of BS7799. The proposals were discussed by representatives from the UK’s DTI, the Confederation of British Industry, CMG Admiral, Microsoft, Unisys, Baltimore Technologies and the Post Office. Computing, 14 December 2000, p. 6.Security spend must rise,Liesbeth Evers. According to a research report released by Forrester Research, security managers plan to triple their budgets over the next four years. However, even with this increase, half of the 50 security managers questioned said that the lack of money would prevent them from implementing all the security measures that were required. Frank Prince, the author of the report, The Security Market, predicts that by 2005, many companies would have implemented automated E-business systems such as hands-free procurement. “Automated processes need automated security”, he said. “Firms will struggle with cross-company security, as this requires agreeing with standards at many levels.” Companies should make business managers responsible for all aspects of security, and should formalize this by creating an integrated corporate security policy. Over time, criminals will discover new ways to use the Internet to aid crime. Computing, 7 December 2000, p. 67.Crossing the wireless security gap,Alan Radding. Wireless security is difficult to implement, requiring organizations to piece together myriad technologies. Most organizations would prefer to support only a single security model for E-commerce, preferably the Internet model in use today. E-commerce in the wired world relies primarily on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), but when you try to move this approach to the wireless world, you immediately encounter problems starting with cellular phones with Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) capabilities. WAP phones are pretty limited when it comes to security and lack the CPU power and memory necessary for RSA encryption, a key element of SSL. WAP devices include their own security protocol, Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS). This is equivalent to SSL but it uses less resource-intensive encryption algorithms, such as elliptic-curve cryptography. Wireless messages travel through the air to the carrier’s transmitter, where they are received and passed to a gateway that funnels them into the conventional wired network for transmission to the destination. At the gateway, the WTLS message is converted into SSL. For a brief moment, the message sits unencrypted inside the gateway, creating a security vulnerability. Many of the obstacles confronting wireless security will disappear with the widespread adoption of third-generation wireless technology. The third-generation phones will be IP-based and sport more processing power, memory and bandwidth, which should allow end-to-end SSL security. By combining third-generation wireless with smart cards and biometrics, organizations should finally have a unified security system that works for both the wireless and wired worlds.

20|1||How to Construct Cryptographic Primitives from Stream Ciphers|AbstractA general stream cipher with memory (SCM) mode in which each ciphertext symbol depends both on the current and on the previous plaintext symbols is pointed out. It is shown how to convert any keystream generator into the SCM mode and the security of both the modes is discussed. It is proposed how to construct secure self-synchronizing stream ciphers, keyed hash functions, hash functions, and block ciphers from any secure stream cipher in the SCM mode. Rather new and unusual designs can thus be obtained, such as the designs of block ciphers and (keyed) hash functions based on clock-controlled shift registers only.

Accordingly, the group decided to conduct a detailed commercial, corporate and technical assessment of all key players in the market during the second half of 2000. This article will look at the specification that drove the selection and test process and will cover the key technical parameters which were used to assess each offering. It will go on to detail the topology, machines and attacks that were used to make the assessment. It will also attempt to give some insight into the process that the group has adopted to keep abreast of all key ‘best of breed' security products and the companies that provide them. 
20|2||Controlling Risks of E-commerce Content|AbstractTraditional approaches to security are failing as we move towards ever more open networks and business models. The combined trends of outsourcing and joint ventures have rendered passé the concept of a secure perimeter shell and a firewall to protect it, as we extend the boundaries of trust outside of our former closed spheres. But perimeter firewalls are also becoming deficient for other reasons, as E-commerce content and applications contain increasingly active functionality that can neither be inspected nor controlled using perimeter firewalls alone. This means that organizations must examine their own ‘risk appetites’ to arrive at their own ideal balance of E-risks against E-benefits. This session explores the status and future trends for E-commerce content security, derived from practical experience in securing one of the largest corporate networks.

While exploring the issue of violation of safeguards by trusted personnel, with specific reference to Barings Bank and the activities of Nicholas Leeson, this paper provides an understanding of related information security concerns. In a final synthesis, guidelines are provided which organizations could use to prevent computer security breaches. 
20|2||Alternative Method for Unique RSA Primes Generation|AbstractThis paper describes a new method for generating RSA primes. While the primes generated according to this method satisfy all of the existing requirements for making RSA encryption and signature generation secure and efficient, they possess two additional properties. First, the RSA primes derived by different parties will always be different. This is a highly desirable property in view of possible disputes around the authenticity of a digital signature. Second, it will not be necessary to store any seed values to verify that these primes were generated according to the prescribed procedure. This is achieved by incorporating the required information about the seeds into the primes themselves without weakening the security properties of the RSA primes.

Each vulnerability superficially appears to be the result of something such as a coding flaw in one case, or a configuration weakness in another. Given the large number of firewall vulnerabilities that have surfaced in recent years, it is important to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding both what firewalls actually do when they receive incoming traffic and what can go wrong when they process this traffic. An intuitive starting point is to create a firewall dataflow model composed of discrete processing stages that reflect the processing characteristics of a given firewall. These stages do not necessarily all occur in all firewalls, nor do they always conform to the sequential order indicated in this paper. This paper also provides a more complete view of what happens inside a firewall, other than handling the filtering and possibly other rules that the administrator may have established. Complex interactions that influence the security that a firewall delivers frequently occur. Firewall administrators too often blindly believe that filtering rules solely decide the fate of any given packet. Distinguishing between the surface functionality (i.e., functionality related to packet filtering) and the deeper, dataflow-related functionality of firewalls provides a framework for understanding vulnerabilities that have surfaced in firewalls.

20|5||Information Systems Audit Trails in Legal Proceedings as Evidence|AbstractAustralian State and Commonwealth Governments are interested in the collection, storage and presentation of audit trail information, particularly within a legal framework. Law enforcement agencies have a legal obligation to keep audit records of all activity on information systems used within their operations. Little to no research has been identified in relation to the use of internal audit systems for evidentiary purpose.A brief history of audit trails is given with requirements for such audit trails beyond the year 2000.The Queensland Police Service (QPS), Australia, is used as a major case study . Information on principles, techniques and processes used, and the reason for the recording, storing and releasing of audit information for evidentiary purposes have been studied.To assist in determining current practice in the Australian Commonwealth and State Governments the results of an Australia wide survey of all government departments are given and contrasted to the major study for QPS.Reference is also made to the legal obligations for authorization of audit analysis, expert witnessing and legal precedence in relation to court acceptance or rejection of audit information used in evidence.It is shown that most organizations studied generate and retain audit trails but the approach is not consistent nor is it comprehensive. It is suggested that these materials would not withstand a serious legal challenge. 
20|5||Multi-party Fair Exchange Protocol Using Ring Architecture Model|AbstractWe present a new protocol which allows multiple parties to exchange electronic items over the Internet in a secure and fair way. This allows either each party to get what it expects to receive, or neither party to receive anything. This protocol is applicable to various electronic businesses, for example, electronic shopping, group purchases, electronic voting, electronic auctions, and electronic bidding. The multi-party fair exchange protocol using the ring model is more efficient and robust than the protocol using the full-mesh model proposed by SEMPER. Our protocol reduces its communication complexity and simplifies its recovery procedures compared with SEMPER’s.

20|6||Access Control in Document-centric Workflow Systems â An Agent-based Approach|AbstractWorkflow Systems are increasingly being used to streamline organizations’ business processes. During the execution of business processes, information often traverses organizations’ networks as documents. With the proliferation of the Internet, documents travel across open networks. These documents can, however, contain potentially sensitive information. The documents used in Workflow Systems must therefore be protected from unauthorized access.This paper enumerates three access control requirements of workflow environments, including the well-known principle of separation of duty. Thereafter the CSAC (Context-sensitive Access Control) model is presented to address the requirements. In conclusion it is demonstrated how this model can be implemented in an agent-based architecture. 
20|6||Hiding Digital Information Using a Novel System Scheme|AbstractThis work builds on Lin and Lee’s document protection scheme, termed as Confused Document Encrypting Scheme (CDES), to present a novel strategy that could hide digital information and provide secret communication between two communication parties. Lin and Lee invented a document protection scheme to transmit large quantities of secret information. However, their design strategy is only suitable for single-byte character-based text document. The proposed scheme presents a novel strategy that modifies the restrictions in Lin and Lee’s work. Any kind of digital data, not only the plain text, can be employed as a carrier or as a secret in the proposed system. The proposed method utilizes the hexadecimal representation of digital data in a manner that ensures it will have many practical applications. In addition, the procedure is easy to implement and capable of transmitting large quantities of secret information.

20|7||Evaluating Trust in a Public Key Certification Authority|AbstractWith the growth of many different public key infrastructures on the Internet, relying parties have the difficult task of deciding whether the sender of digitally signed message is really who the public key certificate says they are. We have built an expert system that calculates the amount of trust, or trust quotient, that one can place in the name to public key binding in a certificate. The structure of the expert system is based on the CPS framework of Chokhani and Ford (RFC 2527), whilst the relative importance of the various factors that comprise the trust quotient, were determined by interviewing PKI experts from around the globe. This paper discusses the knowledge analysis strategy employed to collect this expert information and how we used it to develop the KBS. The analysis of the results of the interviews are also presented, and they can be summarised succinctly as “there are some factors concerning trust in a PKI which nearly all experts agree upon, and there are other factors in which there is very little agreement at all”. The importance of identifying contextual factors when building a knowledge base is very important. In many cases, a disagreement between experts, as shown by a bimodal split in importance, was traced to differences in context and we show how this can be a source of new knowledge. 
20|7||Hierarchical key assignment without public-key cryptography|AbstractVLSI chips make possible the hardware devices employed in today’s computing environment for security functions. Controlling access in a hierarchy is an interesting research topic in computer security. Many investigations have been published in the literature with solutions involving assigning cryptographic keys to users at different access clearance levels. However, the existing schemes require a large number of costly arithmetic operations with large integers. This type of system is difficult to implement in a chip with lower computation ability. In this paper, we present a solution, suitable for a low cost chip, to the hierarchical control problem. The proposed scheme has promising characteristics such as high computational efficiency, little required memory in the chip and low cost implementation. This method possesses all of the dynamic properties that appear in existing methods.

While many of us are still internally processing the recent events, it is important for information security professionals to capitalize on this new shift in security consciousness. This article explores six specific ways in which the recent attacks have changed the way we practice information security in America. For each, there are specific actions that proactive information security specialists can and should take without delay.

Although preventative techniques such as access control and authentication attempt to prevent intruders, these can fail, and as a second line of defence, intrusion detection has been introduced. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are implemented to detect an intrusion as it occurs, and to execute countermeasures when detected.Usually, a security administrator has difficulty in selecting an IDS approach for his unique set-up. In this Report, different approaches to intrusion detection systems are compared, to supply a norm for the best-fit system. The results would assist in the selection of a single appropriate intrusion detection system or combine approaches that best fit any unique computer system.

20|8||The Benefits of a Notification Process in Addressing the Worsening Computer Virus Problem: Results of a Survey and a Simulation Model|AbstractComputer viruses present an increasing risk to the integrity of information systems and the functions of a modern business enterprise. Systematic study of this problem can yield better indicators of the impact of computer viruses as well as a better understanding of strategies to reduce that impact.We conducted a Computer Virus Epidemiology Survey (CVES) on the World Wide Web to examine indicators of the impact of computer viruses. A major finding from the CVES is that multiple indicators of the impact of computer viruses reveal a problem growing more severe that affects large, as well as small, organizations. Another important finding is that apparently undetectable viruses caused only about 15% to 21% of problems reported in workgroups using antiviral software, leaving a substantial amount of damage due to viruses that were probably detectable. Another important finding is that viruses not detected despite regular updating of antiviral software caused only about 15% to 21% of virus problems reported in workgroups using antiviral software. The possible reasons for failure to detect include improper configuration of software and the inability of all known anti-virus detectors to detect. A related implication is that a substantial amount of damage due to viruses could probably have been prevented by regular updating of antiviral software.We also used the CVES in the development of a simulation model for the spread of computer viruses in workgroups in order to analyze the effect of a notification process on control. Our major finding is that the process of notification, whether by human behaviour or by technology, substantially reduces the impact of computer viruses in workgroups. For example, if a workgroup has a period of vulnerability when only 80% of its workstations are effectively using antiviral software, then even a 50% probability of notification of a detected virus substantially reduces the burden. An added benefit of maintaining an environment with high effective antiviral software usage and high levels of notification is that greater rates of communication rates events that can potentially transmit computer viruses within the workgroup actually become protective reduce the impact of computer viruses in the workgroup. Anecdotal observations also indicate that the process of notification is significant in controlling the spread of “new” viruses not yet detectable by software, although the process of notification from law enforcement authorities to workgroups was not in the simulation model.More formally, the reduced impact of computer viruses in a workgroup due to a protective effect of greater rate of communication events that can potentially transmit computer viruses corresponds to a situation when a computer virus introduced into the workgroup produces, on average, less than one copy in the workgroup. This threshold corresponds to the basic reproduction ratio in epidemiology that describes the spread of infectious disease. 
20|8||Computer crimes: theorizing about the enemy within|AbstractA majority of computer crimes occur because a current employee of an organization has subverted existing controls. By considering two case studies, this paper analyzes computer crimes resulting because of violations of safeguards by employees. The paper suggests that various technical, procedural and normative controls should be put in place to prevent illegal and malicious acts from taking place. Ultimately a good balance between various kinds of controls would help in instituting a cost-effective means to make both accidental and intentional misconduct difficult. This would also ensure, wherever possible, individual accountability for all potentially sensitive negative actions. 
20|8||Cryptography Regulations for E-commerce and Digital Rights Management.|AbstractStrong encryption is an urgent need for e-commerce development, as it allows the privacy and secure transactions of the financial data. International regulations must allow the spreading of e-commerce and the associated encryption products, in order to establish a secure e-commerce environment that customers can trust and allowing an international deployment of e-commerce solutions without restrictions.
