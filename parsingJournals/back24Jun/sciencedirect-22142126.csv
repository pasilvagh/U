18|1||Behavioral classification and detection of malware through HTTP user agent anomalies|A high proportion of modern botnets uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with its command servers and to perform a wide range of malicious activities. Nonetheless, detection of HTTP botnets is still a real challenge. Botmasters currently implement multiple techniques to hide their activity within the large amount of network traffic. On the other hand, although malware HTTP headers include multiple anomalies, little are being accounted for during detection. This paper analyzes anomalies in the HTTP user agent header field within malware traffic. It presents a taxonomy of malware user agent anomalies and uses this taxonomy in order to propose an appropriate detection mechanism.
18|1||MASON: Mobile autonomic security for network access controls|Smartphones are on par with modern desktop environments in terms of operating system and hardware functionality. As a consequence, threats to desktop environments are also applicable to smartphones in addition to traditional threats to mobile phones. End-user management of security configurations that mitigate smartphone threats is complex and error-prone. As a consequence, misconfiguration of a security configuration may unnecessarily expose a smartphone to known threats. In this paper, a threat-based model for smartphone security configuration is presented. To evaluate the approach, a prototype Android security app, MASON, is developed to automatically manage firewall configurations on behalf of the end-user. A case study based on firewall access control demonstrates how automated firewall configuration recommendations can be made based on catalogues of countermeasures. These countermeasures are drawn from best-practice standards such as NIST 800-124, a guideline on cell phone and PDA security and NIST 800-41-rev1, a guideline on firewall security configuration.
18|1||Smatch: Formal dynamic session management model forÂ RBAC|This paper extends RBAC sessions with shareability, reusability and switchability properties. We define the Smatch (Secure MAnagement of swiTCH) model in which authorized users can join, leave, reopen and reuse dynamic sessions. In Smatch, subjects can also share sessions and dynamically switch their role or function with other subjects from the same or different organizations. Subjects can authenticate using their function which will automatically activate the set of roles associated with this function. The Smatch model is based on the situation calculus which extends first order logic with actions. It provides means to specify contextual access control and authentication policies which apply to control functional behavior of dynamic sessions. We formally analyze decidability and complexity of several problems like decision, planning and proof of properties in the Smatch model. We also suggest an implementation of Smatch using Eyeos, an open-source web based Operating System.
18|1||A conceptual framework of info structure for information security risk assessment (ISRA)|Information security has become a vital entity to most organizations today due to current trends in information transfer through a borderless and vulnerable world. The concern and interest in information security is mainly due to the fact that information security risk assessment (ISRA) is a vital method to not only to identify and prioritize information assets but also to identify and monitor the specific threats that an organization induces; especially the chances of these threats occurring and their impact on the respective businesses. However, organizations wanting to conduct risk assessment may face problems in selecting suitable methods that would augur well in meeting their needs. This is due to the existence of numerous methodologies that are readily available. However, there is a lack in agreed reference benchmarking as well as in the comparative framework for evaluating these ISRA methods to access the information security risk. Generally, organizations will choose the most appropriate ISRA method by carrying out a comparative study between the available methodologies in detail before a suitable method is selected to conduct the risk assessment. This paper suggests a conceptual framework of info-structure for ISRA that was developed by comparing and analysing six methodologies which are currently available. The info-structure for ISRA aims to assist organizations in getting a general view of ISRA flow, gathering information on the requirements to be met before risk assessment can be conducted successfully. This info-structure can be conveniently used by organizations to complete all the required planning as well as the selection of suitable methods to complete the ISRA.
18|1||Semantic aware attack scenarios reconstruction|Intrusion analysis is a resource intensive, complex and expensive process for any organization. The reconstruction of the attack scenario is an important aspect of such endeavor. We tackle in this paper several challenges overlooked by existing attack scenarios reconstruction techniques that undermine their performances. These include the ability to identify and extract novel attack patterns and the correlation of heterogeneous multisensor alerts. We propose a novel attack scenario reconstruction approach that analyzes both implicit and explicit relationships between intrusion alerts using semantic analysis and a new intrusion ontology. The proposed approach can reconstruct known and unknown attack scenarios and correlate alerts generated in multi-sensor IDS environment. Moreover, our approach can handle for the first time both novel attacks and false negative alerts generated by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Our experimental results show the potential of our approach and its advantages over previous approaches.
18|1||QaASs: QoS aware adaptive security scheme for video streaming in MANETs|Real-time video streaming is delay sensitive. It has minimum bandwidth and QoS requirements. Achieving target QoS for video streaming is challenging in a decentralized and self-organized MANET. Cryptography algorithms offer confidentiality of shared data, but they have computation cost. Our work addresses the issue of delay overhead caused by the introduction of cryptography that directly affects video streaming performance. Our proposal is motivated by the possibilities of adaptive security and multimedia service. We make an effort to identify why, when and how to deploy adaptation. We propose QaASs (QoS aware Adaptive Security scheme), an adaptive mechanism that counters the effect of delay overhead by adapting cryptography and multimedia properties, providing QoS while maintaining a required level of security. We evaluate our proposal through implementation and simulation.

18|2-3||Advanced remote user authentication protocol for multi-server architecture based on ECC|We have reached an era where desired web services are available over the networks by click of a button. In such a scenario, remote user authentication plays the most important role in identifying the legitimate users of a web service on the Internet. Researchers have proposed a number of password based authentication schemes which rely on single server for authentication. But, with tremendous advancements in technology, it is possible to engage multiple servers in authenticating their clients in order to achieve better security. In this paper, we propose an efficient password based authentication protocol for multi-server architecture. The protocol provides mutual authentication using smart card and is based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography, therefore offers best security at a low cost. In 2011, Sood et al. proposed a multi-server architecture protocol using smart cards. In this paper, we improve Sood et al. scheme by increasing its security and reducing the computation cost. The protocol is based on the concept of dynamic identity that uses a nonce based system and has no time synchronization problem.

In contrast, OTA updates for applications on the secure elements (such as smart cards) are still hindered by the challenging hardware and certification requirements.
18|2-3||Virus in a smart card: Myth or reality?|Smart cards are often the target of software or hardware attacks. The most recent attacks are based on fault injection which modifies the behavior of the application. We demonstrate that it is possible to design applications in such a way that they become intentionally hostile while being hit by a laser. Later, a third party can deliver such an application to be deployed on SIM cards without being detected by a code review or a static analysis. We propose an evaluation of the propagation effect and the generation of hostile applications inside the card. To detect such a hostile application we introduce a mutation analysis that checks the ability of an application to be malicious. We implement this analysis in a SmartCM tool; thereafter evaluate its capacity to detect such a fault based mutant.
18|2-3||Hardware accelerated smart-card software evaluation supported by information leakage and activity sensors|System integration density increased tremendously in recent years, resulting in various problems for designers. First, a variety of dependability issues were a direct consequence from high clock frequencies and system-on-chip complexity, such as thermal, power, and stability challenges. Furthermore, deep sub-micron semiconductor processes were increasingly prone to single-event-upsets and multiple-event-upsets caused by logic degradation and environmental sources. Besides these reliability issues, the intentional introduction of faults into the system by adversaries, is of increasing concern to system developers of smart-cards. Therefore, there is a strong need for hardware-accelerated evaluation techniques during the design phase to identify weaknesses in cryptographic software implementations. To map power and fault models to such FPGA-based evaluation systems, characterization and benchmark approaches are described in literature, using general purpose benchmark software. Unfortunately, such non-specialized software can lead to various evaluation problems. Therefore, this paper proposes an hardware-accelerated methodology for the investigation of software implementations in the security and dependability domains. The applicability of the approach has been shown using a general available system-on-chip implementation.
18|2-3||Risks induced by Web applications on smart cards|The evolution of new smart cards with improved processing power and memory size makes it possible to integrate a web server. This provides a way to simplify the integration of smart card to all existing equipments using standard protocols. However it opens up the possibilities to existing Web attacks that exploit Web application vulnerabilities. In this paper, we focus on the most common and dangerous attack named cross site scripting (XSS) and we propose solutions to prevent and check if the Web application is well developed by applying secured development methodology.
18|4|http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/22142126/18/4|DCT based reversible data embedding for MPEG-4 video using HVS characteristics|Recently, many data embedding schemes using the quantized DCT coefficients have been proposed for achieving the robustness. However, most of the schemes lack to strike a trade off between the embedding capacity and the visual quality. Achieving more embedding capacity by maintaining the visual quality has become a challenging task. Most of the DCT based data embedding schemes result in various visual distortions for not considering the HVS characteristics while embedding. The widely used visual quality measure PSNR is not sufficient to assess the quality of the distorted image/video content. However, the HVS based visual quality metrics PSNR-HVS and PSNR-HVS-M are very much suitable when the data is embedded in the frequency domain using DCT. We propose two reversible data embedding schemes which embed the data during the process of MPEG-4 compression of video. The first scheme achieves good visual quality in terms of HVS based metrics which can be useful for high fidelity watermarking applications and the second scheme achieves higher embedding capacity by maintaining better visual quality which can be useful for the steganographic applications.
18|4||Hadamard transform based adaptive visible/invisible watermarking scheme for digital images|In this work, a novel and adaptive visible/invisible watermarking scheme for embedding and extracting a digital watermark into/from an image is proposed. The proposed method uses an adaptive procedure for calculating scaling factor or scaling strength using sigmoid function in Hadamard transform domain. The value of scaling factor is governed by a control parameter. The control parameter can be adjusted to make the watermarking scheme as either visible or invisible. The proposed methodology facilitates in preserving ownership rights and prevents the piracy of digital data which are considered to be the basic needs of digital watermarking. As proposed watermarking process is carried out in Hadamard transform domain, it is more robust to image/signal processing attacks. The experimental results and performance analysis confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme.
18|4||Secret image sharing using grayscale payload decomposition and irreversible image steganography|To provide an added security level most of the existing reversible as well as irreversible image steganography schemes emphasize on encrypting the secret image (payload) before embedding it to the cover image. The complexity of encryption for a large payload where the embedding algorithm itself is complex may adversely affect the steganographic system. Schemes that can induce same level of distortion, as any standard encryption technique with lower computational complexity, can improve the performance of stego systems. In this paper, we propose a secure secret image sharing scheme, which bears minimal computational complexity. The proposed scheme, as a replacement for encryption, diversifies the payload into different matrices which are embedded into carrier image (cover image) using bit X-OR operation. A payload is a grayscale image which is divided into frequency matrix, error matrix, and sign matrix. The frequency matrix is scaled down using a mapping algorithm to produce Down Scaled Frequency (DSF) matrix. The DSF matrix, error matrix, and sign matrix are then embedded in different cover images using bit X-OR operation between the bit planes of the matrices and respective cover images. Analysis of the proposed scheme shows that it effectively camouflages the payload with minimum computation time.
18|4||On the security of certain e-communication types: Risks,Â userÂ awareness and recommendations|Electronic communication is nowadays ubiquitous, irreplaceable and powerful, but because of its significance, the impact on an individual, if something wrong happens, is negligible. A literature review was conducted with the aim of analyzing the term of electronic communication itself as well the aspect of its security. The analysis was performed only on certain popular e-communication types (e.g. e-mail, social media and smartphones). The objective was to review electronic communication in general and to determine if the public is aware of risks concerning it. As a result we concluded that electronic communication is mainly misunderstood and that the public is becoming aware of its security and privacy risk.
18|4||An improved ridge features extraction algorithm for distorted fingerprints matching|The performance of a fingerprint matching system is affected by the nonlinear deformation introduced in the fingerprint impression during image acquisition. Many matching algorithms have been proposed to deal with the nonlinear distortions of the fingerprint images. Recently, these distortion issues can be solved by using incorporating ridge feature with minutiae. In this paper, we proposed a novel ridge feature extraction algorithm to improve the accuracy of fingerprint matching and the time of ridge feature extraction process. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm archives 1.8 times faster than Choi's algorithm on FVC2004-DB1A, FVC2004-DB3A databases. And the equal error rate (ERR) of the ROC for Choi's one is 6.35% and it is only 5.23% for the proposed algorithm on FVC2004-DB3A database. This proved that the proposed algorithm is a reliable and effective algorithm for distorted fingerprints matching.
18|4||Cryptanalysis of a simple key assignment for access control based on polynomial|In 2013, Lo et al. proposed a simple key assignment based on polynomial for access control. Access control in a large leaf class hierarchy let a superior can get the data of his/her subordinates without the approval of the subordinates. The scheme can reduce the computation of leaf class's key generation. It is more efficient and secure than the others. However, we will show an attack in Lo et al.'s scheme in this article. The attack is a compromising attack about how to use the changed polynomial to derive the member's secret key, and then the attacker can access information in the hierarchy.

19|1||Anonymity and closely related terms in the cyberspace: An analysis by example|Anonymity is generally conceived to be an integral part of user's right to privacy. Without anonymity, many online activities would become prone to eavesdropping, making them potentially risky to use. This work highlights on the different aspects closely related to anonymity and argues that it is rather a multifaceted and contextual concept. To support this argumentation, the paper examines as a dual case study the ways anonymity is conceptualised in the case of two well-established but dissimilar protocols employed in the cyberspace on a wide-scale; that is, SIP and Kerberos ones. By surveying the research done for preserving anonymity (and privacy in general) in the context of the aforementioned protocols several useful observations emerge. Our aim is to contribute towards acquiring a comprehensive view of this particular research area, mainly by examining how anonymity is put to work in practice. As a result, the work at hand can also be used as a reference for anyone interested in grasping the diverse facets of this constantly developing research field.
19|1||An efficient and secure anonymous mobility network authentication scheme|The demands of Internet users are steadily increasing. Many users access Internet services through mobile devices via wireless networks. To prevent disclosure of private data, researchers have proposed various anonymous roaming authentication schemes which apply different technologies to provide integral security properties, such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signature, timestamp, etc. Unfortunately, some of these schemes still exhibit security and efficiency issues. In order to provide tripartite authentication and enhance efficiency, we propose an efficient and secure anonymous authentication scheme for mobility networks. According to our performance and security analysis, we can prove that our proposed scheme is able to enhance efficiency and improve security in comparison to previous schemes.
19|1||Concepts and languages for privacy-preserving attribute-based authentication|Existing cryptographic realizations of privacy-friendly authentication mechanisms such as anonymous credentials, minimal disclosure tokens, self-blindable credentials, and group signatures vary largely in the features they offer and in how these features are realized. Some features such as revocation or de-anonymization even require the combination of several cryptographic protocols. The variety and complexity of the cryptographic protocols hinder the understanding and hence the adoption of these mechanisms in practical applications. They also make it almost impossible to change the underlying cryptographic algorithms once the application has been designed. In this paper, we aim to overcome these issues and simplify both the design and deployment of privacy-friendly authentication mechanisms. We define and unify the concepts and features of privacy-preserving attribute-based credentials (Privacy-ABCs), provide a language framework in XML schema, and present the API of a Privacy-ABC system that supports all the features we describe. Our language framework and API enable application developers to use Privacy-ABCs with all their features without having to consider the specifics of the underlying cryptographic algorithms—similar to as they do today for digital signatures, where they do not need to worry about the particulars of the RSA and DSA algorithms either.
19|1||An access control model for cloud computing|Cloud computing is considered one of the most dominant paradigms in the Information Technology (IT) industry these days. It offers new cost effective services on-demand such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). However, with all of these services promising facilities and benefits, there are still a number of challenges associated with utilizing cloud computing such as data security, abuse of cloud services, malicious insider and cyber-attacks. Among all security requirements of cloud computing, access control is one of the fundamental requirements in order to avoid unauthorized access to systems and protect organizations assets. Although, various access control models and policies have been developed such as Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for different environments, these models may not fulfil cloud's access control requirements. This is because cloud computing has a diverse set of users with different sets of security requirements. It also has unique security challenges such as multi-tenant hosting and heterogeneity of security policies, rules and domains. This paper presents a detailed access control requirement analysis for cloud computing and identifies important gaps, which are not fulfilled by conventional access control models. This paper also proposes an access control model to meet the identified cloud access control requirements. We believe that the proposed model can not only ensure the secure sharing of resources among potential untrusted tenants, but also has the capacity to support different access permission to the same cloud user and gives him/her the ability to use multiple services securely.
19|1||Logout in single sign-on systems: Problems and solutions|Web single sign-on (SSO) systems enable users to authenticate themselves to multiple online services with one authentication credential and mechanism offered by an identity provider. The topic is widely studied and many solutions exist. However, logging out of a service using SSO has received less attention. While previous studies note that users want single logout when using SSO, most of the existing services do not offer it, and the identity providers do not even keep track of the open sessions. This article describes challenges related to logout in federated identity management and analyzes unexpected behavior in logout situations. The examples are from the Shibboleth SSO system. Based on the analysis, we give guidelines for implementing reliable logout and describe a polling-based solution for creating a system-wide logout mechanisms that only requires minor changes to the existing code and does not burden the identity provider excessively. In addition to the system-wide logout, our solution gives users the option to log out of only one service. A usability test was conducted to evaluate the solution. The results show that the users liked the ability to choose between the two logout options, but they did not understand the words used to describe them. Another observation was that a majority of the users do not log out of the services at all; they just close the browser window, which should be taken into account in the design of web SSO systems.
19|1||FPGA acceleration of a pseudorandom number generator based on chaotic iterations|As any well-designed information security application uses a very large quantity of good pseudorandom numbers, inefficient generation of these numbers can be a significant bottleneck in various situations. In previous research works, a technique that applies well-defined discrete iterations, satisfying the reputed Devaney's definition of chaos, has been developed. It has been proven that the generators embedding these chaotic iterations (CIs) produce truly chaotic random numbers. In this new article, these generators based on chaotic iterations are redesigned specifically for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware, leading to an obvious improvement of the generation rate. Analyses illustrate that statistically perfect and chaotic random sequences are produced. Additionally, such generators can also be cryptographically secure. To show the effectiveness of the method, an application in the information hiding domain is finally proposed.

19|2||Implementing and evaluating a software-independent voting system for polling station elections|In 2009 the German Federal Constitutional Court introduced the principle of “public nature of elections” (Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, March 2009). This principle requires that when using electronic voting systems it must be possible for the citizen to verify the essential steps in the election process and in the ascertainment of the results reliably and without special expert knowledge. Unfortunately, none of the existing systems complies with this principle. As a result, the use of electronic voting systems in Germany for parliamentary elections has stopped. Nevertheless, electronic voting systems are necessary and would improve the situation, especially for elections with complex ballots and voting rules, for example some local elections in Germany or parliamentary elections in Belgium and Luxembourg. The concept proposed by Volkamer et al. (Volkamer et al., 2011) was analyzed by a legal expert and evaluated to comply with the German legal requirements for local elections in the state of Hesse (Henning et al., 2012). In this paper we specify and concretize processes that were left open in the concept, and implement a prototype. We evaluated this prototype in a user study that was conducted alongside the university elections at the Technische Universtität Darmstadt in June 2013. The results of the study show that most of the participants were satisfied with the prototype and would support its use for the upcoming university elections. We also report some lessons learned.
19|2||Verifying voting schemes|The possibility to use computers for counting ballots allows us to design new voting schemes that are arguably fairer than existing schemes designed for hand-counting. We argue that formal methods can and should be used to ensure that such schemes behave as intended and conform to the desired democratic properties. Specifically, we define two semantic criteria for single transferable vote (STV) schemes, formulated in first-order logic over the theories of arrays and integers, and show how bounded model-checking and SMT solvers can be used to check whether these criteria are met. As a case study, we then analyse an existing voting scheme for electing the board of trustees for a major international conference and discuss its deficiencies.
19|2||How to prove the validity of a complex ballot encryption to the voter and the public|One crucial aspect of any verifiable electronic voting system that uses encryption is the proof that the vote encryption is well-formed, i.e. the proof that the vote encryption encrypts a valid vote accordingly to the race specification. It makes no sense accepting an encrypted vote if, at the end of the election, the vote cannot be included in the tally because it is badly formed.

19|2||Generating pseudo-random numbers by combining two systems with complex behaviors|Cellular automata (CA) due to its complex behavior has several applications such as generating random numbers and cryptography. Because of the intrinsic self-organized property, a pure CA cannot produce a long sequence of random numbers. Non-uniform, controllable/programmable CA or a combination of several automata can be used to increase the length of a produced sequence of random numbers. In this paper, a non-uniform CA as a random number generator has been combined with Langton's ants in order to generate random numbers. Langton's ant is a simple discrete dynamical system, with a surprisingly complex behavior. The combination of some Langton's ants gives them a chaotic behavior and combination of this behavior with complex behavior of cellular automata causes a great efficiency in generating random sequences. Experimental results show that, results given by the combination of ants and CA does not depend on initial value and shows a random behavior, resulting in cycles with very long period lengths and a limited number of cells such that a cycle length of 23n is obtained by n cells. Moreover, some tests such as entropy, avalanche, diehard, NIST and several basic statistical tests have been performed and all of them have been successfully passed.

19|3||Unifying traditional risk assessment approaches with attack trees|As software-intensive systems become more and more complex, so does the assessment of the risks that these systems may have on people's businesses, privacy, livelihoods, and very lives. For very large long-lived industrial programmes, such as the Galileo programme of the European Space Agency (ESA), or the French Pentagon programme for the Ministry of Defence, traditional risk management approaches are now reaching their limit. This is true for tooling, but even more so for humans. This paper proposes novel techniques to deal with cognitive scalability issues in risk assessment studies, amongst which graphical extensions to traditional risk management approaches, such as chain diagrams, and the seamless integration of attack trees. Feedback and results were collected from security experts and other stakeholders, in a large industrial context (namely, the Galileo risk assessment programme) and through dedicated research and development demonstrations. The feedback and results show effective improvements with respect to standard practices, even though fine tuning is still needed to reach an adequate and financially acceptable equilibrium between: (i) dealing with a large number of small independent problems; and (ii) maintaining an overall understanding of the system’s risks and risks treatment.
19|3||Automating the assessment of ICT risk|We present a pair of tools to assess the risk of an ICT system through a scenario-based method. In each scenario, rational threat agents compose attacks against the system to reach some predefined goal. The first tool builds a description of the target system by automatically discovering and classifying the vulnerabilities in its components and the attacks they enable. Starting from this description and from the one of the agents, the other tool applies a Monte Carlo method to simulate step by step each agent and its attacks. By collecting samples on the agent attacks, the number of times they reach a goal and the corresponding impact this tool returns a database to compute statistics to support the assessment. After describing both tools, we exemplify their adoption in the assessment of an industrial control system that supervises a power production plant.
19|3||PeerRush: Mining for unwanted P2P traffic|In this paper we present PeerRush, a novel system for the identification of unwanted P2P traffic. Unlike most previous work, PeerRush goes beyond P2P traffic detection, and can accurately categorize the detected P2P traffic and attribute it to specific P2P applications, including malicious applications such as P2P botnets. PeerRush achieves these results without the need of deep packet inspection, and can accurately identify applications that use encrypted P2P traffic.
19|3||Script-templates for the Content Security Policy|Content Security Policies (CSPs) provide powerful means to mitigate most XSS exploits. However, CSP’s protection is incomplete. Insecure server-side JavaScript generation and attacker control over script-sources can lead to XSS conditions which cannot be mitigated by CSP. In this paper we propose PreparedJS, an extension to CSP which takes these weaknesses into account. Through the combination of a safe script templating mechanism with a light-weight script checksumming scheme, PreparedJS is able to fill the identified gaps in CSP’s protection capabilities.
19|3||Towards a trusted HDFS storage platform: Mitigating threats to Hadoop infrastructures using hardware-accelerated encryption with TPM-rooted key protection|As a follow-on to the authors' previous work, this paper further expands on the concept of creating a trusted Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). We discuss our motivation and evaluate a threat model for HDFS, and address a set of common security concerns within HDFS through infrastructure and software involving data-at-rest encryption and integrity validation. To accomplish these goals, we make use of technology from the Trusted Computing Group, such as the pervasively available Trusted Platform Module. In addition, we discuss our design considerations in building an encryption framework for Hadoop in a trustworthy manner, and describe the results of our experiments creating an encryption scheme for Hadoop utilizing hardware key protections and AES-NI for encryption acceleration. As part of this design we evaluate the recently implemented crypto framework for Hadoop and independently test the performance claims of AES-NI regarding mitigating performance overhead.
19|3||Visual multi secret sharing by cylindrical random grid|Visual secret sharing (VSS) is the process of encoding a secret image into several share images in which the original secret image can be reconstructed and recognized by stacking all of the share images together. VSS has two categories: visual cryptography (VC) and Random Grid (RG). The VC is affected by various drawbacks such as: enlarging the size of original image, need for a codebook and the limitation to encode only one secret image at a time. RG solves the first two drawbacks of VC. To solve the third drawback and provide a solution to optimize recent algorithms, we propose a novel RG-based VSS scheme which encodes several secret images at a time. Instead of using only (2, 2) visual secret sharing, (2, n) and (n, n) is employed. This scheme has the ability to encode one or multiple secret images into multiple shares in place of two shares. In our proposed scheme, instead of Circular Random Grid, a new algorithm named Cylindrical Random Grid is used. It encrypts multiple secret images into two or more shares. To decrypt the first secret image, shares are stacked together. For decrypting of other secret images, one of the stacked shares is rotated in a fixed size over other shares based on the number of secret images which are encrypted. This algorithm is simple to implement and less time consuming.

This is one of the reasons why, the protection of such high investments, in terms of value, has become so important to safeguard. During the past few years, there is an obvious shift in the posture of corporate governance, towards security issues. Nowadays, security breaches are considered to be one of the major concerns of government and corporate organizations around the globe.
19|4-5||Binomial transform based fragile watermarking for image authentication|In this paper, a novel Binomial transform based fragile watermarking technique has been proposed for color image authentication. Binomial transform (BT) is applied to convert each 2 × 2 sub-image block into transform domain in row major order. On average, two bits of authenticating watermark are fabricated on each transformed component starting from the least significant bit position (LSB-0). Inverse Binomial transform (IBT) is performed as post-embedding operation to convert each 2 × 2 transformed block back into the spatial domain. A delicate re-adjustment is performed on the first embedded component to keep the pixel components positive and less than or equal to 255 keeping the fabricated watermark unaltered. The watermark is extracted at the recipient end based on the reverse operation and is verified for authentication using a message digest. Experimental result ensures that the proposed technique obtain higher Payload and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) as compared to existing methods.
19|4-5||A secure remote user mutual authentication scheme using smart cards|Authentication thwarts unauthorised users from accessing resources in insecure network environments. Password authentication based on smart cards is one of the simplest and most efficient authentication methods and is commonly deployed to authenticate the legitimacy of remote users. Based on cryptographic techniques, several password authentication schemes have previously been implemented. However, all of these schemes are vulnerable to various malicious attacks that are discussed below. In this paper, we propose a secure remote user mutual authentication scheme using smart cards that achieves all security requirements. Furthermore, we show that our proposed scheme can withstand various malicious attacks and is more suitable for practical applications than other related schemes.
19|4-5||One-sided leakage-resilient privacy only two-message oblivious transfer|Oblivious transfer protocol (OT) is one of the key components in various cryptographic applications. Construction of OT assumes that local secret state of honest party is perfectly hidden from adversary. However, recently one primary focus of the cryptographic community is to build cryptographic tools resilient to side channel attacks. Such attacks exploit various forms of unintended information leakage which are inherent to almost all physical implementations. In this paper, we initiate a study of oblivious transfer protocol against malicious adversary in the presence of side channel attacks. Specifically, we consider a setting where a cheating sender is allowed to obtain leakage on secret state of the receiver during the protocol execution. We formalize the Definition and propose a construction of a one-sided leakage-resilient privacy only two-message oblivious transfer protocol against malicious adversary. The construction is based on Naor-Pinkas (SODA-2001) two message oblivious transfer protocol. Security of the protocol is based on k-DDH assumption. The proposed protocol can tolerate a constant fraction of leakage from the memory of the receiver. To achieve the proposed Definition, we assume leak free input encoding phase in the proposed construction.

By connecting 4–9 dots in a 3 × 3 grid, the user can set up an unlock pattern which is equivalent to a password or a PIN. As an alternative to the traditional password/PIN, the visual pattern has gained its popularity because of the potential advantages in memorability and convenience of input. However, the limited pattern space and existing attacks such as shoulder surfing, or smudge attack make this mechanism weak in security. In this paper, we analyzed the characteristics of all valid patterns and proposed a way to quantitatively evaluate their strengths. We then designed two types of pattern strength meters as visual indicators of pattern strength. We conducted a user study that involved 81 participants. The results of the user study showed that the presence of visual indicator of pattern strength did encourage users to create visually complex patterns, thus increasing the security of pattern unlock.

A key question for business is determining the potential cost of a future data breach, since this will help in assessing the risk that data breaches pose – most importantly – to the bottom line (Watters, 2012).

The proposed construction provides an extremely low computational cost with respect to most of existing schemes, since the sharing algorithm has a linear time complexity with respect to the number of participants and the size of the share, when the reconstruction algorithm complexity is constant with respect to the threshold t. Furthermore, the proposed construction is provably secure, and has been shown to be robust, confidential, ideal and traceable. An instance of the proposed construction is implemented using a combination of the CRT-based sharing scheme and the Salsa20 stream cipher. Experimental results and comparisons with existing approaches shows that the proposed approach provides very competitive performances, hence is very suitable to share large sized secrets such like digital images.

A public-key cryptosystem is used for both confidentiality and authentication. One such public-key cryptosystem is the RSA cryptosystem. In this paper, a modified and an enhanced scheme based on RSA public-key cryptosystem is developed. The proposed algorithm makes use of four large prime numbers which increases the complexity of the system as compared to traditional RSA algorithm which is based on only two large prime numbers. In the proposed Enhanced and Secured RSA Key Generation Scheme (ESRKGS), the public component n is the product of two large prime numbers but the values of Encryption (E) and Decryption (D) keys are based on the product of four large prime numbers (N) making the system highly secured. With the existing factorization techniques, it is possible only to find the primes p and q. The knowledge of n alone is not sufficient to find E and D as they are based on N. The time required for cryptanalysis of ESRKGS is higher than traditional RSA cryptosystem. Thus the system is highly secure and not easily breakable. A comparison is done between the traditional RSA scheme, a recent RSA modified scheme and our scheme to show that the proposed technique is efficient.
20|-||Trust-based privacy-aware participant selection inÂ social participatory sensing|The main idea behind social participatory sensing is to leverage social friends to participate in mobile sensing tasks. A main challenge, however, is the identification and recruitment of sufficient number of well-suited participants. This becomes especially more challenging for large-scale online social networks with unknown network topology and complex friendship relations. Moreover, the potential sparseness of the friendship network may result in insufficient participation, thus reducing the validity of the obtained information. In this paper, we propose a participant selection framework to address the aforementioned limitations. The nomination module of the framework makes use of a customised random surfer to crawl the requester's social graph and identify suitable nominees. The nominee selection is determined as a function of the members' suitability scores and pairwise trust perception among members. The selection module is responsible for selecting the required participants from the set of nominees based on the nominee's timeliness, the number of participants selected so far and the task's remaining time. Moreover, the selection is done in a way that prevents from the formation of a colluding group among the selected participants. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in terms of selecting a large number of reputable participants with high suitability scores, in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

To identify malicious web sites, the most reliable approach is honeypot, an execution-based method. The vast amount of http traffic makes sandboxing all the web pages impossible. It is not practical in the real environments as it consumes too much computational resource and time. Only 1.3% of websites are malicious. Crawler-based approach might be not easy to find malicious websites effectively, as it has no clue if they are visited by users. Therefore, the proposed system examines only user web requests, not from crawler, in order to catch the real drive-by download web attacks. The challenge is that the web traffic is huge in real networks and an efficient filtering is desired to process large scale user requests efficiently.
20|-||Advanced password based authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks|This era of ubiquitous computing has led to the development of complex communication networks all over the world. Wireless sensors, due to their wide applicability, form a key component of any complex network. But, security is a major challenge in making wireless sensor networks robust. Many remote user authentication schemes have been proposed for authenticating the legitimate users of a wireless sensor network. Most of the recently proposed schemes are vulnerable to one or more security attacks and are inefficient in terms of processing time. In this paper, the scheme proposed by Xue et al. has been reviewed and it has been found that the scheme is vulnerable to impersonation attack, stolen smart card attack, server spoofing attack. This paper proposes a robust and efficient password based authentication scheme which is secure against all well known security attacks. Moreover, the scheme has a low computation and communication cost and does not suffer from time synchronization problem. A formal security analysis has been performed using AVISPA tool to prove the security of the protocol.
20|-||ASH-512: Design and implementation of cryptographic hash algorithm using co-ordinate geometry concepts|Sending and receiving information over the internet is easy, fast and cost effective due to development of information technology. These days most of the information either personal or official is communicated through internet only. Most of the paper based documents are replaced by e-documents. So, there is a need to protect confidential or sensitive information in the computer as well as during transmission. Message digest is a mechanism, which is used to ensure message authentication and integrity. ‘Algorithm for Secure Hashing-512’ (ASH-512) is a novel algorithm proposed in this paper, which is designed using co-ordinate geometric concepts. The algorithm accepts 1024-bits as input and produces 512-bits as output. The algorithm is more secure and easy to construct and thus made this algorithm special. The algorithm is implemented in Java and the results are compared with standard cryptographic hash algorithm-SHA2 (512) and Whirlpool-512.
20|-||Mining a high level access control policy in a network with multiple firewalls|A policy mining approach that aims to automatically extract a high level of abstraction policy from the rules configured on a firewall has been recently proposed (Hachana et al., 2013). This technique is likely to considerably facilitate firewall management. However, protecting the information system of a business organization usually requires the enforcement of more than one firewall. In this paper, we augment the policy mining approach by an additional processing for a network access control policy mining. We develop the problem of integration of Net-RBAC (Hachana, 2014) policies resulting from policy mining over several firewalls in order to mine a high level network policy. Moreover, we show how to verify security properties related to the deployment consistency over the firewalls. We illustrate the network policy mining approach by a realistic example, and we experimentally evaluate the performance of our merger algorithms.
20|-||Blind SVD-based audio watermarking using entropy and log-polar transformation|This paper proposes a blind singular value decomposition (SVD) based audio watermarking scheme using entropy and log-polar transformation (LPT) for copyright protection of audio signal. In our proposed scheme, initially the original audio is segmented into non-overlapping frames and discrete cosine transform (DCT) is applied to each frame. Low frequency DCT coefficients are divided into sub band and entropy of each sub band is calculated. Watermark data is embedded into the Cartesian components of the largest singular value obtained from the DCT sub band with highest entropy value of each frame by quantization. Simulation results indicate that the hidden watermark data is robust against different attacks. The comparison analysis shows that the proposed scheme has high data payload and provides superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art watermarking schemes reported recently.

The study presented in this paper shows that work safety in cyberspace depends on the users' knowledge of threats and their appropriate response to them. Based on the results, it has been established that user awareness should be raised, users should be informed of threats and undergo suitable education on work safety in cyberspace.
20|-||A cloud-based secure authentication (CSA) protocol suite for defense against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks|Cloud-based services have become part of our day-to-day software solutions. The identity authentication process is considered to be the main gateway to these services. As such, these gates have become increasingly susceptible to aggressive attackers, who may use Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to close these gates permanently. There are a number of authentication protocols that are strong enough to verify identities and protect traditional networked applications. However, these authentication protocols may themselves introduce DoS risks when used in cloud-based applications. This risk introduction is due to the utilization of a heavy verification process that may consume the cloud's resources and disable the application service. In this work, we propose a novel cloud-based authentication protocol suite that not only is aware of the internal DoS threats but is also capable of defending against external DoS attackers. The proposed solution uses a multilevel adaptive technique to dictate the efforts of the protocol participants. This technique is capable of identifying a legitimate user's requests and placing them at the front of the authentication process queue. The authentication process was designed in such a way that the cloud-based servers become footprint-free and completely aware of the risks of any DoS attack.
